<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome! My name is Tammie Phillips. Please feel free to call me Tammie. I live in Little Rock, AR in the United States. I am the mother of two sons, four dogs, and one chicken. I love learning, reading, and living life to the fullest.</p>

<p>On weekends, I am usually in the kitchen cooking and baking or in my garden. If you can't find me there, then I'll be at the park either walking or with my dogs. I love to go and just sit and look at the river, sometimes to think and sometimes just to be in nature. I also love to budget, code, and people watch.</p>

<p>I have a large family. I have seven brothers and two sisters. I have lots of extended family. My goal in life is to live life to the fullest and to help those that are coming behind me. I love helping people and helping them to be the best that they can be.</p>
